### Style Examples:

**Example 1 - Trading:**
❌ VERBOSE: "I found myself wandering through the bustling marketplace of Whiterun today, where I happened upon Belethor's General Goods. The shopkeeper, a somewhat sly Breton named Belethor, was there as usual. After some negotiation, I decided to sell him some of the iron daggers I had been crafting at the Skyforge. The transaction went smoothly, and I felt a sense of satisfaction at having earned some coin for my efforts."

✅ CONCISE: "Sold five iron daggers to Belethor at his shop in Whiterun for 150 gold. Satisfying to profit from my smithing work at the Skyforge."

**Example 2 - Combat:**
❌ VERBOSE: "As I was traveling along the road near Riverwood, I suddenly found myself under attack by a group of bandits who had been lying in wait. There were three of them in total, and they seemed quite determined to relieve me of my possessions. The battle was fierce and intense, with swords clashing and arrows flying through the air. I managed to defeat them all, though not without sustaining some injuries in the process. After the fight was over, I searched their bodies and found some useful supplies and a small amount of gold."

✅ CONCISE: "Ambushed by three bandits on the road near Riverwood. Killed all three in close combat - took a sword cut to my arm but survived. Looted 47 gold and a steel mace from their bodies."

**Example 3 - Emotional/Relationship:**
❌ VERBOSE: "I had a very meaningful and heartfelt conversation with Lydia at Breezehome today. She opened up to me about her feelings regarding her role as my housecarl, and I could tell that she has been struggling with some doubts about whether she is truly worthy of the position. I tried my best to reassure her and let her know how much I value her loyalty and companionship. By the end of our talk, she seemed much more at ease, and I felt that our bond had grown stronger as a result of this vulnerable moment we shared."

✅ CONCISE: "Lydia confided her doubts about being worthy as my housecarl at Breezehome. Reassured her - she means more to me than just a servant. Our bond feels stronger now. Grateful for her trust."

**Example 4 - Discovery/Quest:**
❌ VERBOSE: "While exploring the ancient Nordic ruins of Bleak Falls Barrow, I stumbled upon something quite remarkable. Deep within the innermost chamber, past all the draugr and traps, I discovered what appeared to be a wall covered in strange, glowing writing. As I approached it, I felt a strange sensation wash over me, and suddenly I understood one of the words carved into the stone. It was a Word of Power, and I could feel its ancient magic resonating within my very soul. This must be what it means to have the blood of a dragon."

✅ CONCISE: "Found a Word Wall in the depths of Bleak Falls Barrow. Learned 'Fus' - felt the dragon tongue burn into my mind. The dragonborn legends are true. I carry this power now."

Include 5-10 relevant tags focusing on:
- Character names mentioned (e.g., "belethor", "guards", "arcadia")
